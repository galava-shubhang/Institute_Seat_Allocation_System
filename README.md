# Institute Seat Allocation System - DSA Mini Project

This project was developed as part of the CS202M - Data Structures and Algorithms course, contributing to my Minor Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

In collaboration with my teammate, Ashish Manash, we built a software system that simulates an institute seat allocation process.
The objective was to create a program that efficiently manages seat allotment for students based on their entrance exam ranks and institute preferences.
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a priority-based seat allocation system, where students can be placed in their preferred branches 
across multiple participating institutes through a centralized, common admission process.

The detailed project report is present in the Project_Report.pdf file. 
The entire program has been implemented in Python.
