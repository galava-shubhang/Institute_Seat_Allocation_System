This project is part of the CS202M - Data Structures and Algorithms course, contributing to my minor in computer science and engineering.

In collaboration with my teammate, Ashish Manash, we built a system that simulates an institute seat allocation process. The objective was to create a program that efficiently manages seat allotment for students based on their ranks in a common entrance examination, considering their institute preferences. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a priority-based seat allocation system, where students can be placed in their preferred branches across multiple participating institutes through a centralized, standard admission process.
